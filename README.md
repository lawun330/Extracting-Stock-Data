# Extracting-Stock-Data
This notebook is the final assignment of the second course of the *Applied Data Science Specialization* by <b>IBM</b> on <b>Coursera</b> platform. I wrote my own solutions.
This repository is a reflection of my learning journey. I learned how to extract data from websites using either `yfinance` or webscraping Python library such as `BeautifulSoup`. 
This is also available on *IBM Watson Studio* at https://jp-tok.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/92d25ac9-396a-4a38-ae49-ddb43e00f995/view?access_token=9046343d27f30a5c496a2698247daddaa77f469c41dcfb24d8d0c3eaeecda090&context=cpdaas.
